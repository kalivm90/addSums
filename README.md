# Objective 
Find all unique combinations of positive integers that sum up to a given target value = N, considering a specified lenght for each combination = K

# Purpose 
This is in response to a TikTok where someone explained how they were caught off guard by this interview question.

This was not easy. If I was given this problem with a time constraint I would have failed to solve it. He did not mention the language the problem was supposed to be done in. 
It would add a another level of difficulty if it was not Python or JavaScript/TypeScript 

There may be a better more optimal way to do this, this is just my solution.

I DID NOT THOROUGHLY TEST THIS!!!!


# Usage 

```$ python3 addSums.py k n```

- python3 may just be python in your environment

it outputs a list of combinations that equal N
